# Post Installation Setup Scripts

Post installation scripts to set up work environment on a new computer system. 

# Usage
Linux work environment setup
```
git clone https://github.com/ishank-juneja/setup-scripts.git setup_scripts
cd setup_scripts
chmod +x ubuntu-post-installer.sh 
sudo ./ubuntu-post-installer.sh
```

The current state of the above script is that it (because of some snap related thing) requires user to enter password at some point.
